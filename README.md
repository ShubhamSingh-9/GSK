# GSK

Digdata-GSK organized Steup-up where it was opportunity to work on reakl work problems where they are coming up with new medicine Miraculon_B and compared with the standard existing medicine standard care the target column is where the partient resposne is taken where its been asked how well the medicien react with the cancer.

Task 01:
We suppose to carry out data cleaning and give insites from the data than build a model to prdct the resposn eof pateinet on the given inpurt.
Cleaning process that is base of Machien learning is carried out and Duplicates, Nan, missing, outliers data wrere removed than the Exploratry Data Anslysis is carried out and we realised te data is of Supervised type and two model on Linear Regresion and Random foreset is bul the logistic regression has higher accuracy so we deploy that model on server to predict teh outcome.

Task 02:
Its has been seen there is some adverse effcet usibg the Miraculon_B drugs when the Protein concentartion in the patient is high we are given a cleaned data and need to build a Machine leraning model to get the doctor predict wheather they shud recommnet the new drugs to patinet or not.
