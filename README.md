# GSK

Digdata-GSK is a company that specializes in developing new medicines for cancer treatment. They organized a Step-up event where participants had the opportunity to work on real-world problems related to their latest drug, Miraculon_B. Miraculon_B is a novel drug that is compared with the standard care in terms of its effectiveness and safety. The target column in the data set is the patient response, which indicates how well the drug reacts with the cancer cells.

Task 01:
The participants were supposed to perform data cleaning and provide insights from the data, and then build a model to predict the patient response based on the given input. Data cleaning, which is the foundation of machine learning, was carried out and duplicates, NaN values, missing values and outliers were removed. Then, exploratory data analysis was performed and it was found that the data was of supervised type. Two models, linear regression and random forest, were built and compared. The logistic regression model had higher accuracy, so it was deployed on the server to predict the outcome.

Task 02:
It was observed that there were some adverse effects of using Miraculon_B when the protein concentration in the patient was high. The participants were given a cleaned data set and asked to build a machine learning model to help the doctors decide whether they should recommend the new drug to the patient or not.
